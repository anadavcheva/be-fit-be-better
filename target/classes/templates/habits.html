  <h4>1: Start Your Morning with a Protein-Rich Breakfast</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We get it — mornings are busy. It can be easy to fly out the door with a piece of fruit or cup of coffee and consider it breakfast. Or, maybe you skip your morning meal altogether. But, starting your morning with a protein-rich breakfast is a healthy habit you’ll want to get behind! A breakfast rich in protein has been shown to boost metabolism, satiety, and muscle mass, while decreasing the urge to snack! Maybe breakfast is the most important meal of the day, after all. </p>

  <h4>2: Drink a Glass of Water Right When You Wake Up</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Did you know your body wakes up in a mild state of dehydration after a long night of sleep? Starting your morning with a hydrating glass of water not only replenishes your fluid stores but it also helps to flush out toxins, promote healthy lymphatic flow, kickstart your metabolism, boost your energy, and even support a glowing complexion.

      With benefits like these, be sure to mix up your daily routine with a tall glass of water and soak up this healthy habit</p>

  <h4>3: Eat For Nourishment Not Restriction </h4>
  <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
    <p>Instead of focusing on what you can’t eat, focus on filling your plate with a variety of colors, wholesome ingredients, and balanced proportions. Goodbye restriction — we’re welcoming the healthy habit of nourishment! </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h4>4: Double or Triple Your Meal Prep Recipes </h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Portion out any leftovers and store them in the freezer for those busy days. Without worrying about cooking or cleaning, you’ll be more efficient with your time and less likely to snack or make unhealthy food choices. </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h4>5: Be Mindful of How Much Sugar You Eat & Swap With Healthy Alternatives </h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>One of the best healthy habits to follow? Read ingredient labels! Sneaky sugars come in many forms and can easily make their way onto your plate. Be mindful of what foods you’re consuming and the amount of sugar they contain. Avoiding processed ingredients and artificial sugars is the best way to stay on track with your goals, but that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy your favorite foods. </p>
